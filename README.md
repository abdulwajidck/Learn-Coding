# Learn-Coding
I am making a good collection of articles which will help beginners to start coding, intermediate coders to fine tune their skills. And advanced people to get a strong grip over the coding skills. 

I used to search a lot about how to get started in programming in my free time. When I met one of the room mate for the first time, I came to know that people are unaware of the infinite possiblities they have in the world of Internet. I am going to share a bunch of materials and guides to learn programming for free and for a price. 

## Free of Paid?
In my experience so far, I came to know that free or paid doesn't make a difference, but the problem is that how much the article creators loved coding. Many of the resources are just for fun, and to fund their dreams. Some of the articles just take forever to read. Sometimes because the creator carries the article forward with unwanted explanations and or just becuase they show off too much of their skills.
